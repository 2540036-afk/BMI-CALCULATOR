# BMI Calculator Application Using Python and Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a web-based application developed using Python and Streamlit.  
It allows users to calculate their BMI by entering their weight and height. The application provides instant results along with BMI category classification.

This project demonstrates the use of Python programming, modular design, input validation, and an interactive Streamlit-based user interface.
